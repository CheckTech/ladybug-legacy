# Instructions for Installing Ladybug + Honeybee:

##### Follow initial steps 0-5 for Ladybug functionality and additional 6-9 for full functionality.


### LADYBUG

0. If you have an old version of LB+HB, download the file [here](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&fork=hydra_1&id=Remove_Ladybug_and_Honeybee) and open it in Grasshopper to remove your old Ladybug  and Honeybee version.

1. Make sure that you have a working copy of both Rhino and Grasshopper installed. Rhino 6 comes with Grasshopper pre-installed but, for Rhino 5, you will have to install Grasshopper from [here](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/page/download-1)

2. Open Rhino and type "Grasshopper" into the command line (without quotations).

3. If using Rhino 6, skip this step and continue to step 4.  If using Rhino 5, install GHPython 0.6.0.3 by downloading the file [here](http://www.food4rhino.com/app/ghpython) and drag the .gha file onto the Grasshopper canvas.

4. Select and drag all of the userObject files (downloaded with this instructions file) onto your Grasshopper canvas. You should see Ladybug and Honeybee appear as tabs on the grasshopper tool bar.
